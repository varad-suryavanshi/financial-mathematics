# 💸 ML in Finance — Financial Mathematics Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook exploring the intersection of **Machine Learning** and **Financial Mathematics**. It includes practical implementations of ML techniques applied to financial data — such as time series forecasting, risk modeling, or asset price prediction.

---

## 📘 Contents

- `Financial_Mathematics.ipynb`: The main notebook containing all code, visualizations, and explanations.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies to run the notebook.
- Sample use cases may include:
  - Time-series prediction
  - Portfolio optimization
  - Risk metrics & simulation
  - Financial data preprocessing

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the notebook locally:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-finance-project.git
   cd ml-finance-project
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Start Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

---

## 🛠 Dependencies

The notebook uses the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `yfinance` (or any other financial data library)

You can find them all in the `requirements.txt` file.

## 📈 Future Ideas

- Integrate deep learning models (LSTM, RNN) for time series
- Use more robust financial APIs (like Alpha Vantage, Quandl)
- Extend to real-time trading simulations or backtesting
